## Features

- Pure front-end implementation. Registration/Login/Chat are demos (no backend).
- You can expand with third-party APIs (e.g., Firebase, CometChat) for real data.
- All pages are navigated via the top menu, and data is shown on the front end.

## Suggestions for Expansion

To implement real user data, chat, matching algorithms, and review storage, connect to a backend or third-party cloud service (e.g., Firebase). You can use this project as a front-end base for further development.
